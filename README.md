This project used to work with [wercker](https://app.wercker.com). It was complicated more than needed and used webhooks/app credentials. After the release of Github Actions, i refactored the project to work with Github Actions and put everything under a single repository at [Yengas/yengas.github.io](https://github.com/Yengas/yengas.github.io).
