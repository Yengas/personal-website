Hello, I'm YiÄŸitcan! I have been programming sincem my late highschool years. I'm currently studying **Computer Science** at **Trakya University**.

I've played with various technologies and programming languages for the past 5 years. I've had the chance of working with Web, Mobile and Desktop platforms.

Even though it was hard to decide and dedicate myself on something; i chose to improve myself on `Microservice` architecture and `Container` technologies, using `Golang`, `Python` and `NodeJS` as my main languages. I'm currently focusing on `DevOps` and `Backend` development.

You can follow my projects and codes on [Github](https://github.com/Yengas), and read my opinions/tutorials about various programming topics on this blog!
